Colour Picker
=============

Not sure why this isn't built in to OS X. Colour Picker.app is a nice easy way to launch the system colour picker from spotlight or the dock. It's literally a 2 word applescript application.

```
choose color
```

I'd recommend giving it the icon from DigitalColor Meter.app, in /Applications/Utilities.
